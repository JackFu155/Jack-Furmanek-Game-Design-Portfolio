AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE INCLUDED UNITY GAME

This Game was coded as part of a group effort by myself and six other Game Design and Development Students
under the instruction of a senior Graphic Design student Abigail Dye who created all assets for the game

The seven of us did all the coding for this game based on Abby's instructions over a six week period to show
off at Imagine RIT 2019. It was a popular exhibition.

Following it's debut, Abby started an unsucessful kickstarter to raise funds to develop the game further, so
the game demo has been left in our hands.

The included zip file is the source code for the demo showcased at Imagine RIT 2019. It was created using
Unity Version 2018 3.10f1 (64 bit)
